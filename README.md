# Graphical User Interfaces Design final project
This repository shows our final project of the Graphical User Interface design course at Warsaw University of Technology. This project aimed to create the seller-dashboard app based on some requirements from the client. In this project, we did not write any backend/logic code, but only focused on best practices and principles of creating the best UI/UX design.
